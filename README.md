### __Final Submission__

##### Work done: 
- Implemented BERTSel (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07588v1.pdf) as a baseline model using BERT.

- Implemented TANDA architecture using Huggingface models, tested it on 4 pretrained models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBert, ALBERT) and compared the results.

- Implemented a non-transformer based efficient and lightweight model which also gives accurate results (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02349.pdf).
